## How to Use This Context

### For Developers
1. **Start Here**: Read this README to understand the project structure
2. **Architecture**: Review `project/architecture.md` for system design
3. **Standards**: Follow guidelines in `development/` directory
4. **Templates**: Use templates from `templates/` directory for consistency

### For Code Reviews
1. Use `development/code-review-guidelines.md` for comprehensive review criteria
2. Apply scoring framework from the guidelines
3. Document decisions in `team/decision-log.md`
4. Use `templates/code-review-report-template.md` for assessments

### For AI Assistants
1. Reference `ai-context/preferences.md` for interaction guidelines
2. Use project context from `project/` directory for accurate assistance
3. Follow coding standards from `development/coding-standards.md`
4. Apply templates for consistent output formatting

## Maintenance
- Update documentation as the project evolves
- Review and refine guidelines quarterly
- Ensure all team members are familiar with the structure
- Keep AI context preferences current with team needs
